## Problem: 
To create a platform to help young people understand the jobs, identify which ones are right for them, and the next step they could take.

## Prototype Overview:

The following prototype images showcase the design and functionality of our bot app. These visuals are crafted to align closely with the existing pageâ€™s color scheme, typography, and overall design aesthetic, ensuring a seamless integration into the current user experience. Each screen is designed to reflect the app's core features and maintain consistency with our established visual identity.

## Teck stack:

- Next.js - allows severside rendering to have both our mock backend and front together in the same application
- Tailwind CSS
- Supertest - for testing
- Javascript

## MVP 1:

- Mock backend - Quicker to have a functioning application
- Low fidelity wireframe
- Front end
- QA - Functional test - ensure our mockend is working at intended.

## MVP 2:

- Open AI - replace the mock backend with real data using given API key
